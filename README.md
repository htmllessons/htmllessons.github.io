<br>
<h1>Creating a github account</h1>
<br><video width="400" controls>
  <source src="acc.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<br>[-] Create an account name (preferrably teamnameteamnumber.) Ex: fantasticfive618 <b><u><i>NO CAPITOL LETTERS!</i></u></b>
<h1>Creating and downloading a repository</h1>
<br>
<br>[-] Go to github.com/{your username}
<br>[-] Click the "+" sign at the top-right of the github website and click "new repository"
<br>[-] Under "repository name" type the name of your username, followed by ".github.io" (example: fantastic5_618.github.io)
<br>[-] Add a description. This step is optional, but I would strongly recccomend adding "The website of {your team name]"
<br>[-] Keep it on public (you have to pay to make it private, and for a website, that is really not necessary.) 
<br>[-] Leave "initialize this repository with a README" unchecked
<br>[-] Click "create repository"
<br>[-] Click "set up in desktop"
<br>[-] If prompted, click open in Github Desktop
<br>[-] In Github, change the path to C:\users\{your computer username}\documents\GitHub\{whatever you called your project} <br>IT SHOULD ALREADY BE LIKE THIS, JUST BE SURE.
<br>[-] Now, in file explorer, open your documents folder.
<br>[-] Navigate to GitHub\{whatever you called your project}
<br>[-] You should be in an empty folder.
<br>
<h1>Creating your first webpage</h1>
<br>
<br>[-] Open "Sublime Text 3" (you should have downloaded it earlier, if you didn't, now would be a convient time to do so. It dosen't take too long. You are ready to start coding!<br>
<pre>
	<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
	&lt;html&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;
			&lt;h1&gt;My team website!&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! you are ready to start coding!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;
	</code>
</pre>
<br>[-] Save the file as <i>index.html</i>
<br>[-] Navigate back to the folder, and there should be a new file called index.html
<br>[-] Right-click on it and select "open with" and select "Google Chrome"
<br>[-] Your file should open on Google Chrome.
<br>
<h1>Let's start editing!</h1>
<br>[-] It is important to know that HTML works with <i>lots</i> angle brackets.
<br>[-] Each command you type will be inside of angle brackets, and closed with a slash:
<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;code goes here&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;code goes here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;code goes here&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;code goes here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;code goes here&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<br>[-] And if you know JavaScript, you can imbed it in HTML!
<pre><code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;JS code goes here&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h1>Dictionary of terms:</h1><br>
<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  --  Title, Large font
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  --  Subtitle, Large font
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;  --  The smallest of the "H" family
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  --  Paragraph - use around content of the site
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  --  surround groups of elements with divs to style things such as background, outline color, font, text size, and animations
