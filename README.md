<br>
This is a project that will make it easy for you to learn how to create your own FTC or FLL team website!
<br>
Prerequisite programs (all freeware)
<br>[-] Sublime text 3  --  sublimetext.com/3
<br>[-] Google Chrome  --  google.com/chrome
<br>[-] Github Desktop (with an account)  --  desktop.github.com
<br>
What we will cover in this introduction to programming
<br>[-] Creating a new HTML file and opening it
<br>[-] Add a header and paragraph
<br>[-] Use "div's" to break apart your website into a more visually-appealing page
<br>[-] Use CSS to style your website to make it look awesome
<br>[-] Use A tags to create a link
<br>[-] Use Google Anaylitics to gather user information
<br>
So lets get started!
<br>
Creating and downloading a repository 
<br>
<br>[-] Go to github.com/{your username}
<br>[-] Click the "+" sign at the top-right of the github website and click "new repository"
<br>[-] Under "repository name" type the name of your username, followed by ".github.io" (example: fantastic5_618.github.io)
<br>[-] Add a description. This step is optional, but I would strongly recccomend adding "The website of {your team name]"
<br>[-] Keep it on public (you have to pay to make it private, and for a website, that is really not necessary.) 
<br>[-] Leave "initialize this repository with a README" unchecked
<br>[-] Click "create repository"
<br>[-] Click "set up in desktop"
<br>[-] If prompted, click open in Github Desktop
<br>[-] In Github, change the path to C:\users\{your computer username}\documents\GitHub\{whatever you called your project} IT SHOULD ALREADY BE LIKE THIS, JUST BE SURE.
<br>[-] Now, in file explorer, open your documents folder.
<br>[-] Navigate to GitHub\{whatever you called your project}
<br>[-] You should be in an empty folder.
<br>
Creating your first webpage
<br>
<br>[-] Open "Sublime Text 3" (you should have downloaded it earlier, if you didn't, now would be a convient time to do so. It dosen't take too long. You are ready to start coding!<br>
<pre>
	<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
	&lt;html&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;
			&lt;h1&gt;My team website!&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! you are ready to start coding!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;
	</code>
</pre>
<br>[-] Save the file as __index.html__
<br>[-] Navigate back to the folder, and there should be a new file called index.html
<br>[-] Right-click on it and select "open with" and select "Google Chrome"
<br>[-] Your file should open on Google Chrome.
<br>
Let's start editing!
<br>
Dictionary of terms:<br>
